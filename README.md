# Little-Traveler

## Conflict Prevention
**IMPORTANT!**
To avoid conflict, before modifying non-code files (level and art assets), please go to [chechout file sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Raw4orohCqlCXNWfu6pfoJkLtve7UDI0CvcxxvpRpXI/edit#gid=0) to check out the files and delete the checkout after modification is finished.

## Possible Issues
1. If a window pops up when lauching the game saying "Missing LittleTraveler Modules", simply click "Yes" to rebuild the project.

2. If an error pops up when rebuilding the project saying "LittleTraveler could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually.", delete the Binaries, Intermediate, and Saved folders, then right click on LittleTraveler.uproject and select Generate Visual Studio Project Files (needs installation of Visual Studio).
